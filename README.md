# Learning object recognition and Deep Learning

It's a simple python notebook with some experiments about object recognition in video streams using Deep Learning.

### Required Libraries

Keras

OpenCV

TensorFlow( with keras )


### How does it work?

It uses a Convolutional Neural Network model (Resnet50 and VGG16) with a pre trained imagenet weights.

#### See it in action

The black label is the current object, and the green label is the recognition in action.
